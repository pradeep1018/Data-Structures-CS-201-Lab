# Data-Structures-CS-201-Lab
### Compilation of Data Structures and Algorithms implemented in CS 201.
## Lab1
### Performs the following operations on a linked list:
- Insertion at beginning and end of a linked list
- Deletion at beginning and end of a linked list
- Deletion of specific node
- Find a node
- Size of a linked list
- Display the values stored in all nodes of a linked list
### Performs the following using the concepts of linked list:
- Addition and subtraction of two given polynomials
- Evalutaion of a polynomial
### Solves the equation n# = (1^1) * (2^2) * (3^3) * .......* ((n-1) ^ (n-1) ) * (n^n ), where n is any non negative integer, using the concepts of linked list. Each digit of the result is stored as a node in linked list due to memory constraints of storing very large numbers and operations are performed accordingly.
## Lab 2
### Performs the following operations on a stack:
- Push
- Pop
- Print number of elements in stack
- Check if stack is empty
- Check if stack is full
### Performs the following operations on a queue:
- Enqueue
- Dequeue
- Print number of elements in queue
- Check if queue is empty
- Check if queue is full
### Converts a given infix expression to its equivalent postfix expression
### Evaluates a given infix expression to find its value
### Finds kth lexicographically smallest stack permutation of n numbers 1,2,...,n pushed into the stack in same order
## Lab 3
### Performs the following operations on a BST/AVL tree:
- Construction of binary search tree(BST) by inserting and deleting elements
- Construction of AVL tree by inserting and deleting elements
- Find a specific element in a tree
- Find number of nodes and leaves in a tree
- Print preoder(in a non recursive way), inorder, postorder and level order of a tree
- Find depth and width of a tree
- Find lowest common ancestor of two given nodes
- Print the path from an ancestor node to a descendant node
- Find the length of diameter of a tree
- Find perimeter of a tree
## Lab4
### Performs BFS, calculates number of nodes found at each distance from the source and finds number of tree edges, cross edges, forward edges and backward edges in a given graph
### Performs DFS, calculates the finishing time of source and finds number of tree edges, cross edges, forward edges and backward edges in a given graph
### Prints topological ordering of a given graph
### Finds the shortest path of all vertices from the source of a given graph using Dijkstra's Algorithm
### Finds the shortest path of all vertices from the source of a given graph using Bellman Ford Algorithm
## Lab5
### Finds arborescence of minimum weight of a given directed graph using Edmonds' Algorithm
## Lab6
### Performs Johnson's algorithm using different heap structures, like array heap, binary heap, binomial heap and fibonacci heap, as priority queue in Dijkstra's Algorithm part
